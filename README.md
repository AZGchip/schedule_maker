this webpage creates a simple schedule that keeps imputed text saved as long as the browser is not closed. almost all of the html is built using Jquery, except for the menu.
each input/display box is tied to a time and will change color based on if it is before,after or during its asigned time. each box also has a bar that will transition from green to red as time passes, giving a visual display of time left in the hour. 
Each text field supports multiple lines and can be resized to fit more text.
